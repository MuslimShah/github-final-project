# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple interest calculator that calculates the simple interest based on the provided inputs of principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## How to Use

1. Input the following values:
   - `p`: Principal amount
   - `t`: Time period in years
   - `r`: Annual rate of interest

2. The calculator will then compute the simple interest using the formula:  
simple interest = p * t * r

## Example

For instance, if you input:
- `p`: $1000
- `t`: 3 years
- `r`: 5%

The calculated simple interest would be:  
simple interest = 1000 * 3 * 0.05 = $150
